# Sorting-Algorithms-Benchmark
This application benchmarks five sorting algorithms by time and size of input. This project was developed for a college assignment that taught computational thinking and algorithms. 

This repo contains the code the application and a PDF of a report about the project. It also contains a non-executable JAR. To run the JAR, input: java -cp benchmarker.jar ie.atu.sw.Runner

## Notes About the Assignment 
Students were required to:
- Write an application to benchmark five sorting algorithms
- The five sorting algorithms must be chosen according to the following criteria:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort) 5. A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort)
- Write a report which introduces the algorithms and discusses the results of the benchmarking.
